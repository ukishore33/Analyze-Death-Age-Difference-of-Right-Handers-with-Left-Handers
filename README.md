# Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers

Performing Statistical operations including probability prediction using Bayers Equation and Many more! | This project is part of a Assesment of MedTourEasy Company internship Program.

First we imported the Necessary Libraries, Imported the Data , Then we found probability of Left hander in a Population, then we used the same function and predicted the population of Right Handers. In these prediction we used the Bayers Equation for estimation of probabilities.
Next we found out the difference between these two probabilities presently, and then we found out the difference for 2012 year. Then we visualised the results. Finally the file we worked with is attached below.
